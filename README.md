# awscloudresume
This is my version of completing The Cloud Resume Challenge utilizing AWS Cloud Services.

Step 1. Develop the necesaary foundation al skills to better understand the cloud paltform in which you are looking to complete this challenge on. For me it was out of Azure or AWS as they are the two biggest platforms to date and foundational courses are fairly easier to find. Although i did not test for the AWS Cloud Practioner Certification, I' vve completed the Cloud Quest Challenge course provided by AWS and obtianed a digital badge verfiying my knowledge of the foundational skills. At the moment, i am currently prepping to take an Assocaite level certification for either Solutions Architect or SysOps Associate. 
Once you gain a further understaning of the services move on to step 2.

Step 2. Preparing Your Website 
Not much is needed to get started with the backbone of your static website. Some simple HTML put in place to reference your Resume is all that is needed. If you are not Familiar with HTML,  a simple google search can lead you on the right path. Its pretty straight forward. I also utilized ChatGPT to further enhance my html file with items that i knew i wanted added to my site but couldnt not come to terms on how to implement them. 

Step 3. Add Some CSS
After you have gotten the bare metal infrastructure of your site completed, its time to add a bit of seasoning to the mix to sort of personalize it and bring it to life. CSS can be a bit tricky and confusing, but if you know exactly what you would like to see on the site you can leverage AI to assist and give you a template, as i did and thenn customize it from there.
